# maznote
Latex style sheets and examples for creating documents with Mazzoleni dynamics notation.
Note that there are multiple style sheets called MazzoleniNotation.sty that are in use throughout this repo. That is because there are different approaches to implementing the Mazzoleni notation. The stlye sheet in the [notation](https://github.com/EMSSL-CODE/maznote/tree/master/notation) folder holds an implementation of the most current version of the notation, but any of the sheets will show you how to implement the notation in Latex.
## Folders
There are two folders: [notation](#notation) and [dynamicsNotes](#dynamicsnotes). Different people may have different preferences for implementing the Mazzoleni notation in Latex, so rather than keep one style sheet for all purposes we are instead keeping one style sheet and document to define the notation (in the notation folder) and one folder that has documents using the notation for notes from dynamics lectures.
### notation
The notation folder holds a style sheet and a document describing the Mazzoleni notation. This folder holds the most current guidelines for using Mazzoleni notation as defined by Andre Mazzoleni and his students.

### dynamicsNotes
The dynamicsNotes folder contains course notes. The notation in these documents may or may not be the most current version. If you are planning to use the Mazzoleni notation and you want a cannonical reference go to the notation folder. If you want to see the notation being used to describe dynamics go to the dynamicsNotes folder.
